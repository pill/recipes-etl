Title: Easy Tiramisu Recipe (no raw eggs!)

This is by no means "authentic" tiramisu in that it has no raw eggs, but it's just as tasty!

Ingredients:
- About 1.5 packages of HARD lady fingers (NOT the soft ones. Imported from Italy preferred.)
- 2 C strong coffee/espresso
- 9 Tbsp rum or marsala wine (Can half this for a less pronounced alcoholic flavor)
- 1 C heavy cream
- 1-1.5 lb mascarpone
- 2/3 C sugar, divided
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2-3 Tbsp cocoa powder
- Handful chopped chocolate/chocolate shavings (optional)

Instructions:
1. Prepare coffee/alcohol for dipping: Combine coffee in a wide, shallow bowl, and combine with about 5 Tbsp of the rum. Set aside.

2. Prepare mascarpone/cream mixture: Whip heavy cream with 1/3 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp rum, until you have soft peaks. Then, slowly fold in the mascarpone along with the other 1/3 C sugar and 2 Tbsp rum. Whip altogether until nice and fluffy. Set aside.

3. Prepare tiramisu layers: Dip each side of a lady finger into the coffee/rum mixture for no more than 1-2 seconds per side (DO NOT DIP TOO LONG; This is the biggest mistake in making tiramisu. NO SOGGINESS!). Then, carefully lay in a pan (8x5 in), making sure all the ladyfingers are lined up side by side; trim if needed to fix snugly into pan. Then, add a generous, even layer of the mascarpone/cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, smoothing them out on the edges with a spatula. Dust with some cocoa powder with a colander/sieve. Repeat the ladyfinger layer with the final mascarpone layer, and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings if using.

4. Refrigerate tiramisu: Refrigerate for at least 6 hours to allow it to set, and allowing the lady fingers to soften well. Cut with a clean knife, wiping off between slices for the cleanest edges, and enjoy!

Prep time: 30 minutes
Chill time: at least 6 hours
