# UUID Generation Improvement

## Problem

UUIDs weren't in the staged JSON files (`data/stage/kafka_recipes/*.json`), only in the database. This was inefficient because:
- UUIDs had to be generated during database insertion
- Couldn't check for duplicates before hitting the database
- No way to reference recipes by UUID until after insertion
- Had to write UUIDs back to JSON files after the fact

## Solution

**Generate UUIDs deterministically during JSON creation**, not during database insertion.

Since UUIDs are deterministic (based on title + ingredients), we can generate them as soon as we have the recipe data.

## What Changed

### Before (Old Flow)
```
1. Parse recipe from source
2. Save JSON (no UUID) ‚Üí data/stage/entry_123.json
3. Load JSON to database
4. Generate UUID during insert
5. Optionally write UUID back to JSON
```

### After (New Flow)
```
1. Parse recipe from source
2. Generate UUID from recipe data
3. Save JSON with UUID ‚Üí data/stage/uuid.json
4. Load JSON to database (uses UUID from JSON)
```

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated `json_processor.py` (lines 39-51)

Added UUID generation during JSON creation:

```python
# Generate deterministic UUID from ingredients
ingredient_fingerprint = '|'.join([
    ing.item[:50] for ing in recipe_data.ingredients[:5]
])
fingerprint_hash = hashlib.md5(ingredient_fingerprint.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
source_url = f"staged:{fingerprint_hash}"

# Generate UUID
uuid = generate_recipe_uuid(recipe_data.title, source_url)
recipe_dict['uuid'] = uuid
```

### 2. Updated `activities.py` (lines 505-522)

Use UUID from JSON if available:

```python
# Check if UUID already exists in JSON
existing_uuid = recipe_json.get('uuid')

# Create recipe with UUID from JSON
recipe = Recipe(
    uuid=existing_uuid,
    title=...,
    ...
)
```

### 3. Removed write-back logic from `load_json_to_db`

No longer need to write UUID back to JSON after database insertion.

## Benefits

### 1. **Performance** ‚ö°
- One write operation instead of two (no write-back needed)
- UUID available immediately after JSON creation

### 2. **Efficiency** üéØ
- Can deduplicate before database insertion
- Faster lookups using UUID from JSON

### 3. **Easy File Management** üìÅ
- Filename is the UUID (e.g., `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json`)
- Can find recipe files directly by UUID
- No need to search through numbered files

### 4. **Consistency** ‚úÖ
- Same UUID generation logic everywhere
- UUID available throughout the entire pipeline

### 5. **Data Lineage** üìä
- Track recipes from source ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí Database
- Consistent identifier at all stages

## Impact

### For New Recipes
All new JSON files will automatically have UUIDs:

```bash
# Process Kafka recipes
python3 scripts/processing/kafka_consumer.py

# Check the UUID
cat data/stage/kafka_recipes/entry_123.json | jq .uuid
# Output: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"
```

### For Existing JSON Files
Old JSON files without UUIDs can be backfilled:

```bash
python3 scripts/add_uuids_to_json.py data/stage/kafka_recipes/
```

## Example

### JSON file

**Before:**
```
data/stage/kafka_recipes/entry_187269623404929688.json
{
  "title": "Crispy Yurinchi Chicken Breast",
  "ingredients": [...],
  "instructions": [...]
}
```

**After:**
```
data/stage/kafka_recipes/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json
{
  "title": "Crispy Yurinchi Chicken Breast",
  "uuid": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "ingredients": [...],
  "instructions": [...]
}
```

## Testing

To verify UUIDs are being generated:

```bash
# Process a recipe
python3 scripts/processing/kafka_consumer.py

# Check JSON has UUID
ls data/stage/kafka_recipes/ | head -1 | xargs -I {} cat data/stage/kafka_recipes/{} | jq .uuid

# Should output a UUID like:
# "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"

# Find a specific recipe by UUID
cat data/stage/kafka_recipes/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json | jq .title
```
